# --- Shared awk guard for a rule match pattern -------------------------------
# Prepended to the hook programs (awk "$JIT_AWK_GUARD"'...'), so the same verdict is
# reached by pre-tool-hook.sh, pre-path-hook.sh and jit-dry-run.sh.
#
# Two failures, and only one of them is loud:
#
#   1. An undefined escape. Measured 2026-08-10 on awk version 20200816: of the ASCII
#      letters, only \a \b \f \n \r \t \v \x survive; every other \<letter> compiles to
#      the bare letter, so ~gh\s+pr becomes ghs+pr and matches nothing at all. awk does
#      not fail on this. It exits 0. Exit status cannot see this defect, which is why
#      the check here is structural rather than a compile probe.
#   2. A malformed pattern. ~a[b is a fatal awk error (exit 2) raised mid-scan, so the
#      END block never runs and EVERY rule in that index — plus the vocabulary pass and
#      the log line — is silenced by one row. Reproduced against both hooks.
#
# The verdict is deliberately engine-independent. A rule fires on the author machine,
# which is where the drop happens; gawk accepting \s is not a licence to write it, and a
# lint whose answer changes with the runner cannot gate anything.
#
# \n is the one escape rules genuinely need — it anchors on command position,
# (^|[;&|\n] *), because ^ anchors the whole command string and not each line. \t and \r
# are honoured too and are left alone. Everything else after a backslash that is a letter
# or a digit is refused: the author is present, and the fix is one character.
#
# Returns "" when the pattern can be honoured, else a short reason.
# Consumed by the hook awk programs and jit-dry-run.sh, which shellcheck cannot see.
