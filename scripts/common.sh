# --- Shared awk guard for a rule match pattern -------------------------------
# Prepended to the hook programs (awk "$JIT_AWK_GUARD"'...'), so the same verdict is
# reached by pre-tool-hook.sh, pre-path-hook.sh and jit-dry-run.sh.
#
# Two failures, and only one of them is loud:
#
#   1. An undefined escape. Measured 2026-08-10 on awk version 20200816: of the ASCII
#      letters, only \a \b \f \n \r \t \v \x survive; every other \<letter> compiles to
#      the bare letter, so ~gh\s+pr becomes ghs+pr and matches nothing at all. awk does
#      not fail on this. It exits 0. Exit status cannot see this defect, which is why
#      the check here is structural rather than a compile probe.
#   2. A malformed pattern. ~a[b is a fatal awk error (exit 2) raised mid-scan, so the
#      END block never runs and EVERY rule in that index — plus the vocabulary pass and
#      the log line — is silenced by one row. Reproduced against both hooks.
#
# The verdict is deliberately engine-independent. A rule fires on the author machine,
# which is where the drop happens; gawk accepting \s is not a licence to write it, and a
# lint whose answer changes with the runner cannot gate anything.
#
# \n is the one escape rules genuinely need — it anchors on command position,
# (^|[;&|\n] *), because ^ anchors the whole command string and not each line. \t and \r
# are honoured too and are left alone. Everything else after a backslash that is a letter
# or a digit is refused: the author is present, and the fix is one character.
#
# Returns "" when the pattern can be honoured, else a short reason.
# Consumed by the hook awk programs and jit-dry-run.sh, which shellcheck cannot see.

# --- Shared JSON string reader ---------------------------------------------
# Prepended to all three hook programs. Every hook used to read its payload with
# `split(input, f, "\\"")` and take the raw field, which is wrong twice:
#
#   1. It ends a value at the first ESCAPED quote. `gh pr list --search \\"a b\\" --limit 20`
#      arrived as `gh pr list --search ` -- so a `require: --limit` blocked a command that
#      carried --limit, and only when the flag sat after the quote. The require check is a
#      plain index(); it was the subject that had been cut, not the test.
#   2. It never decodes anything. A multi-line Bash command arrives with its newlines as
#      the two characters \\ and n, so a rule anchored `~(^|[;&|\\n] *)` -- where the escape
#      is a real newline to awk -- could not fire on it, ever. Nothing errored, nothing
#      warned; the rule read as enforced and was not.
#
# jit_json_fields() keeps the old quote-split parity (field[even] = key, field[even+2] =
# value) but reports each field as a RANGE of raw pieces, rejoining nothing: a quote whose
# preceding piece ends in an odd number of backslashes was escaped, so it is content and
# the field continues past it.
#
# Ranges rather than strings, because a Write payload carries the whole file body in
# tool_input.content and every literal quote in that body arrives escaped. Concatenating a
# field back together costs a copy of the whole value per escaped quote — measured at
# 359 ms for a 200 KB payload with 8000 of them, against 30 ms before and 44 ms now.
# jit_field()
# materialises a field only when a caller asks for one, and a caller only ever asks for
# the four short values it matches on.
#
# Parity is read off the single piece before the quote, never the joined field: a join
# always inserts a literal quote, so a run of backslashes can never carry across one.
#
# An escape awk cannot represent is left exactly as written rather than swallowed: eating
# the backslash of an unknown escape would turn `\\d` into `d` and hand the matcher a
# subject its author never typed. \\uXXXX is in that set deliberately -- decoding it needs
# UTF-8 assembly no awk here can be trusted to do.
