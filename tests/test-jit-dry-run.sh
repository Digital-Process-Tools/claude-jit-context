# Tests for scripts/jit-dry-run.sh — evaluate a tree's rules where they are written.
#
# The point of the script: JIT_BASE resolves against $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, so a tree that
# is not the session's project dir (a git worktree, a checkout under review) cannot load
# or test its own rules, and nothing says so. The dry-run reads the tree you point it at.
#
# Usage: bash tests/test-jit-dry-run.sh
